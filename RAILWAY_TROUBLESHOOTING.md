# Railway Frontend Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: 502 Bad Gateway

The frontend server is starting and receiving requests, but Railway's Edge Proxy can't communicate with it.

## Steps to Check:

### 1. Check Railway Service Settings
- Go to Railway Dashboard → Frontend Service → Settings
- Look for "Domains" section
- Check if there's a "Target Port" setting
- Make sure it matches the port Railway assigns (usually 8080)

### 2. Check Environment Variables
- Go to Railway Dashboard → Frontend Service → Variables
- Look for any PORT-related variables
- Make sure there are no conflicting port settings

### 3. Check Health Check Settings
- Go to Railway Dashboard → Frontend Service → Settings
- Look for "Health Check" settings
- Make sure the path is set to "/" (not "/health")

### 4. Check Deployment Logs
- Go to Railway Dashboard → Frontend Service → Deployments
- Click on the latest deployment
- Check the logs for any errors

## Possible Solutions:

### Option 1: Manual Port Configuration
If Railway has a target port setting, make sure it's set to 8080 (or whatever port Railway assigns)

### Option 2: Restart the Service
- Go to Railway Dashboard → Frontend Service
- Click "Redeploy" or restart the service

### Option 3: Check Service Status
- Make sure the service shows as "Deployed" and "Healthy"
- If not, there might be a configuration issue

## Current Server Status:
✅ Server starts correctly
✅ Receives requests (GET /)
✅ Uses correct port (8080)
✅ Binds to 0.0.0.0
❌ Edge Proxy can't communicate

The issue is likely in Railway's service configuration, not our code.
