#### Railway Configuration
- **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run preview`
- **Health Check Path**: `/`
- **Port**: `4173`

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Option 1: Railway MySQL Plugin (Recommended)
1. In your Railway project, click "New"
2. Select "Database" ‚Üí "MySQL"
3. Railway will automatically provide environment variables
4. Update your backend environment variables to use the MySQL plugin variables

### Option 2: External Database
If using an external database (like PlanetScale, Supabase, etc.):
1. Get your database connection details
2. Set the database environment variables manually in Railway

## üîÑ Deployment Process

### 1. Initial Deployment
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd VotingSystem

# Install Railway CLI (optional)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link your project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Select the backend service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add all the environment variables listed above
5. Repeat for the frontend service

### 3. Database Initialization
After deployment:
1. Go to your backend service logs
2. Check if the database initialization script ran
3. If not, you can manually trigger it via Railway's shell

## üîó Service Communication

### Frontend to Backend Communication
The frontend needs to communicate with the backend. Update the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your frontend environment variables to point to your backend service URL.

Example:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://voting-system-backend-production.up.railway.app/api
```

### Custom Domains
Railway provides free custom domains:
1. Go to your service settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update CORS settings accordingly

## üìä Monitoring and Logs

### Viewing Logs
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Select a service
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click on a deployment to view logs

### Health Checks
Railway automatically monitors your services:
- Backend: `/health` endpoint
- Frontend: `/` endpoint

## üîí Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive data to your repository
- Use Railway's environment variable system
- Rotate secrets regularly

### CORS Configuration
Update your backend CORS settings to allow your frontend domain:
```javascript
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.railway.app
```

### SSL/TLS
Railway automatically provides SSL certificates for all domains.

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Using Railway CLI
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway up

# View logs
railway logs

# Open Railway dashboard
railway open

# Check service status
railway status

# Redeploy
railway up --detach
```

### Using GitHub Integration
1. Push to your main branch
2. Railway automatically deploys
3. Monitor deployment in Railway dashboard

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs

# Common fixes:
# 1. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
# 2. Check Node.js version compatibility
# 3. Verify build commands
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database environment variables
railway variables

# Verify database is running
railway logs --service mysql
```

#### Frontend Not Loading
```bash
# Check if API URL is correct
# Verify CORS settings
# Check frontend build logs
railway logs --service frontend
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# SSH into service (if available)
railway shell

# View real-time logs
railway logs --follow

# Check service health
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health
```

## üìà Scaling

### Railway Free Tier Limits
- **Backend**: 1 replica, 512MB RAM
- **Frontend**: 1 replica, 512MB RAM
- **Database**: 1GB storage
- **Bandwidth**: 100GB/month

### Upgrading (Paid Plans)
- More replicas for high availability
- Increased RAM and CPU
- Larger database storage
- More bandwidth

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Updating Your Application
```bash
# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin main

# Railway automatically redeploys
# Monitor deployment in dashboard
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Run migrations manually if needed
railway shell --service backend
node scripts/create-database.js
```

### Backup Strategy
- Railway MySQL plugin includes automatic backups
- Consider external backup solutions for critical data
- Export data regularly using Railway's export feature

## üìû Support

### Railway Support
- [Railway Documentation](https://docs.railway.app/)
- [Railway Discord](https://discord.gg/railway)
- [Railway Status](https://status.railway.app/)

### Application Support
- Check logs: `railway logs`
- Monitor health: Visit `/health` endpoints
- Review deployment history in Railway dashboard

## üéØ Best Practices

### Performance
- Use Railway's CDN for static assets
- Optimize build times with proper caching
- Monitor resource usage

### Security
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Enable Railway's security features

### Monitoring
- Set up alerts for service health
- Monitor resource usage
- Track error rates and response times

## üìù Default Credentials

After deployment, your application will have these default accounts:
- **Superadmin**: `superadmin` / `superadmin123`
- **Admin**: `admin1` / `admin123`

## üåê Accessing Your Application

Once deployed, you can access:
- **Frontend**: `https://your-frontend-service.railway.app`
- **Backend API**: `https://your-backend-service.railway.app/api`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-backend-service.railway.app/health`
